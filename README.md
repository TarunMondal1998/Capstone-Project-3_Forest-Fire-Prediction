# Capstone-Project-3_Forest-Fire-Prediction
Forest Fires Prediction using Neural Networks
## Problem statement

Prediction of burned area of forest fires.

## About The Project

Using Data Science and Machine learning, we can build a model that takes in the detected fires dataset learns and detects future fires based on certain Weather report.

Storing the Sourced dataset to MongoDB.

Sklearn for pre-processing

Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib for csv reading, Data Processing, Data Cleaning, Visualization etc.

TensorFlow for development of Neural Networks
